#  What is Pagination?

It's the means by which we can access a large resource by individual parts, like pages.

Consider for something like Facebook's feed, which has potentially infinite content-it is unreasonable to download it all at once.

Ideally, we only download what we need, when we need it. 

Typically, we can request what index.
